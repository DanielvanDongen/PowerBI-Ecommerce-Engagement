These dashboards provide insights into various business performance indicators, including sales trends, profit breakdowns, follower growth, and engagement statistics.

### E-commerce Sales Dashboard

- **Sales vs. Target by Category (Monthly)**: Visual representation of sales performance for categories like Clothing, Electronics, and Furniture, benchmarked against target values.
- **Sub-Category Profit Breakdown**: Detailed profit margins across sub-categories such as printers, bookcases, and electronic games.
- **Top 5 States Ranked by Profit**: Pie chart displaying the most profitable states (e.g., Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh) in terms of sales and profits.

### Follower Engagement Dashboard

This dashboard provides valuable metrics for social media engagement and growth, ideal for tracking audience interaction over time. Key features include:

- **Impressions & AVG Engagement**: Monthly trendline showcasing the number of impressions and the average engagement level of followers.
- **Growth in New Followers (Quarterly)**: Bar graph illustrating the quarterly growth in follower numbers.
- **Average Impression and Engagement Levels (Weekday)**: Line charts displaying average impressions and engagement across different weekdays.

## Thought Process and Insights

- The **E-commerce Sales Dashboard** effectively visualizes critical sales and profit metrics. It allows for quick comparisons between actual sales and target goals, helping businesses identify performance gaps. The inclusion of both category and sub-category breakdowns offers a more granular view, essential for strategic decision-making.
  
- The **Follower Engagement Dashboard** provides actionable insights into social media performance. The graphs are well-organized, clearly presenting follower growth trends and engagement statistics. Such insights are crucial for optimizing content strategies and improving engagement rates.

Both dashboards are user-friendly, with clear visualizations that make it easy to track performance over time. These designs are ideal for data-driven decision-making in both e-commerce and social media marketing domains.
